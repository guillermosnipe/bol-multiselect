# BolMultiSelect

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.1. and RxJS 6.4.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Bol.com multiselect control

This exercise is all about developing a multiselect form control. Because of the nature of the exercise the form is not wired to any real data service, so as soon as you press the "Toepassen" button, the only thing you will see is the output in the console. The output will show you the selected(s) categories.

## Styles

The styles were applied in a theme that was created for this exercise "bol-retail"
